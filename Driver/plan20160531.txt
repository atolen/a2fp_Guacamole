DRIVER FILE: driver.pde

driver contains -- 2d array a[n] is an array of one element's info -- matrix is static, final. Each row is: symbol, name, atomic number, mass. All taken from csv file.
two options from driver:
    1. browse -- shows periodic table, allows you to click on each element for element info -- the properties of that element. Has button that links to react, and button for going back to driver
    2. react -- has buttons for each reaction (fusion, fission, combustion, redox, titration, precipitation) -> buttons lead to options for combinations (which elements, what concentration, bombard a nucleus?)


CLASSES:
    1. driver file, contains buttons to the react file and the browse the elements file, driver will also contain a matrix of the elements -- turns csv w element info into matrix
    2. element page -- displays element info, has a constructor that will make a cute little page based on the element info if user clicks
    3. reaction classes -- one per type , each has a react method that will vary based on rxn type -- reactions use INHERITANCE -- transmutation for fusion & fission, precipitation for some others idk 
    4. periodic table -- constructs based on element that shows info on element when you click on it on the periodic table
    
Core fxnality:
    1. constuct periodic table that you can click to get to the elements
    2. be able to navigate from react to what is reacting
    3. be able to choose reaction
    4. graphics for reactions
    5. library of demo reactions for users to see

Extras:
    1. fancy guac graphics
    2. allow users to choose their own elements for a given reaction
    3. guac !


Prereqs:
    1. need element table for selection of elements for reactions
    2. need reaction graphics fully fxnl

Ind/Collab:
    1. reaction classes can be written individually (interfaces)
