CHEMICAL REACTIONS
---------
-simulate fusion, fission, etc. w processing
-utilizes user input
-how do data structures/algos?


File with Elements and their Attributes -- Element class
Attributes:
	Mass
	Heat of fusion/Vaporization
	Reacts with ? --> can select random element upon creation
	Forms compounds with? --> ^
	Electronegativity
	Ionization Numbers


Reaction Classes:
	Transmutation (Fusion/Fission)
	Precipitation (utilizes Ksp/Temperature)
	
	properties: elements being reacted

use inheritance/interfaces for classes^^

Home Page:
	Options (all of these will be buttons, will take you to a new window):
	1. Browse the Elements
	2. React
	3. Play Guac
	
	
1. Browse the Elements
	a) Will display a prettyful periodic table where you can click on each box and a new window appears
		i) in each new window there will be a picture (?) of the element in its natural form, its basic information, and what it reacts with
2. React
	a) will take the user to another window, where they select the type of reaction they want to do
		Bombs Away
			Fission
				- Pick an Element (a set will be given)
				- Press a button to send a high power neutron into the nucleus
				- calculate random sizes for the resulting nuclei
				- calculate energy released and store number in a var
				- if one or more of the nuclei are large enough, user can fission them again
		Star Formation	
			Fusion
				- pick two elements, they go together
				- form a new element, show user what it is
		Bern Down for What
			Combustion
				- Give a set of Hydrocarbons
				- "Light" button
				- somehow illustrate orange and yellow balls being fire
				- display about of water and CO2 created
		Basic Hoe or Na?
			Titration
				- Choose acids and Bases
				- SA/SB
					- Neutral Salt created, water
				- SA/WB
					- Acidic salt with conjugate base of acid and conjugate acid of the weak base
				- WA/SB
					- Basic salt with cation from base + conjugate base of Weak Acid
				Display the resulting solution
		Battery after 10th
			Redox
				- Have a static list of standard reduction potentials
				- Choose two metals, the one with the lower reduction potential is the oxidizing one
				- Display a voltaic cell with a salt bridge and everything
				- Use the Nernst equation to see if anything actually happens
				- If the reaction isn't spontaneous, then display a "sorry na" window
		Salty
			Precipitation
				- Pick 2 ionic compounds + concentrations
				- if the two precipitate usually, but the concentrations aren't high enough,then it will tell the user the concentrations arent high enough
				- If the two don't precipitate, no precipitation will form
