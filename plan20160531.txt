DRIVER FILE: driver.pde

driver contains -- 2d array a[n] is an array of one element's info -- matrix is static, final. Each row is: symbol, name, atomic number, mass. All taken from csv file.
two options from driver:
    1. browse -- shows periodic table, allows you to click on each element for element info -- the properties of that element. Has button that links to react, and button for going back to driver
    2. react -- has buttons for each reaction (fusion, fission, combustion, redox, titration, precipitation) -> buttons lead to options for combinations (which elements, what concentration, bombard a nucleus?)


CLASSES:
    1. driver file, contains buttons to the react file and the browse the elements file, driver will also contain a matrix of the elements -- turns csv w element info into matrix
    2. element page -- displays element info, has a constructor that will make a cute little page based on the element info if user clicks
    3. reaction classes -- one per type , each has a react method that will vary based on rxn type -- reactions use INTERITANCE -- transmutation for fusion & fission, precipitation for some others idk 
    4. periodic table -- constructs based on element that shows info on element when you click on it on the periodic table
    
Level of importance:
    1. constuct periodic table that you can click to get to the elements
    2. be able to navigate from react to what is reacting
    3. graphics for reactions
