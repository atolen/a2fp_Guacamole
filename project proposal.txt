Project proposal: Team Guacamole: AT, BSS, OG

Chemistry experiments: combining elements, fission, fusion, titration
User will be able to change the: temperature, number of molecules (Concentrations)
User will choose compounds to combine
For extra fun: user can also choose veggies to mix and chop in order to make BOSS guac

We will utilize an Element/Compound class, and each element/compound will be instantiated 
as an object. There will be a couple of reaction classes, split based on the type of reaction.
For example, there will be a combustion reaction class, and transmutation class, a titration class, 
and a precipitation class. Within each of those classes, there will be react methods that take two or more 
elements, concentrations, and temperatures

Based on real calculations (!! APCHEM like a boss) a reaction will either occur or not occur.

Based on the data returned by the reaction class, a graphic window will depict what happens. For example, if titrating
a weak acid with a strong base, the graphic window will show an erlenmeyer flask turn from clear to pink.
